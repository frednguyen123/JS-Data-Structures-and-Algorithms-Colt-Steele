# Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms by Colt Steele

## This course crams months of computer science and interview prep material into 20 hours of video. 
## We start with the basics and then eventually cover “advanced topics” that similar courses shy away from like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm. 

## Start by teaching you how to analyze your code’s time and space complexity using Big O notation. 
## We cover the ins and outs of Recursion.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. 
## We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular searching algorithms. We write 6 different sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   
## Then, we switch gears and implement our own data structures from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.  
## We learn to traverse trees and graphs, and cover Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.  The course also includes an entire section devoted to Dynamic Programming.

## It's interactive -  I give you a chance to try every problem before I show you my solution.

## The "tips and tricks" to solve common problems, but we also focus on building an approach to ANY problem.
