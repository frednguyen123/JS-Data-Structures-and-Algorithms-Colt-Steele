/**
 * BIG O OF SORTING ALGORITHMS
 * 
 * BUBBLESORT
 * Best: O(N)
 * Average: O(N^2)
 * Worst: O(N^2)
 *
 * SELECTION SORT
 * Best: O(N^2)
 * Average: O(N^2)
 * Worst: O(N^2)
 * 
 * INSERTION SORT
 * Best: O(N)
 * Average: O(N^2)
 * Worst: O(N^2)
 * 
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY FOR ALL: O(1)
 * 
 * RECAP
 * Sorting is fundamental
 * Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent.
 * All have average time complexities that are quadratic
 * We can do better ...but we need more complex algorithms!
